# Radio Show Data Processing Scripts

A collection of Python scripts for processing UCLA Radio show data and linking various media files.

## Setup

### Credentials

Before running the scripts, you need to:

1. Obtain a Google Drive service account credentials file
2. Save it as `credentials.json` in the project root directory
3. **Important**: Never commit credentials.json to version control!

## Scripts Overview

### script1.py

- Processes input.csv to create output.csv
- Parses show information from the Subject field:
  - Extracts Show Name
  - Identifies DJs (looks for "DJ" keyword or text after first comma)
  - Creates DJ1, DJ2, DJ3 columns
- Converts dates and times to standard format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Creates Date-Time column matching audio file format (YYYY-MM-DD-HH)

### script2.py

- Adds cover image links to output.csv
- Reads cover_links.csv
- Matches show names (case-insensitive) between files
- Creates new "Cover File Link" column in output.csv
- Links show graphics to corresponding shows

### script3.py

- Connects to Google Drive using service account
- Scans through folders to find audio files
- Creates audio_files.csv containing:
  - Audio file names (YYYY-MM-DD-HH.mp3)
  - Direct links to audio files in Google Drive

### script4.py

- Adds audio file links to output.csv
- Reads audio_files.csv
- Matches Date-Time from output.csv with audio filenames
- Creates new "file-link" column in output.csv
- Links audio recordings to corresponding show times

## File Dependencies

- input.csv: Original show schedule data
- cover_links.csv: Show graphics/cover images data
- audio_files.csv: Audio file links (generated by script3.py)
- output.csv: Final processed file with all linked data
- credentials.json: Google Drive API credentials (private)

## Usage Order

1. Run script3.py to gather audio files from Google Drive
2. Run script1.py to process show and DJ information
3. Run script2.py to add cover image links
4. Run script4.py to add audio file links

The final output.csv will contain complete show information with all associated media links.
